# Visual Music

#### Visual Music is a project to visualize music.

For CS 126's three week final project, I will work on a 3D audio visualizer using SFML and Cinder OpenGL library.

## Background
First, this project is Cinder based, which is a framework created for creative programming, so I would like to work on some coding project.

I like classical music, and I think that every piece / play has its own color and shape. I would love to figure out how to
best visualize them not only with simple shape, but with color and dynamic to represent the attitude of the piece. For instance, look up some Synthesia Piano Videos on YouTube, where people are visualizing the music manually. 

I'm not quite sure how much I can get done in 3 weeks, but I think only some basics stuff can be done in 3 weeks, I will propose my plan below.

## Timeline
#### Week 1:
* Get Cinder and external libraries compiling and linking fine.
* Be able to input an audio file (pick one - .WAV or .mp3).
* Convert the audio to some type of Object. This might rely on research on external library (SFML).

#### Week 2:
* Work on some basic visualization for the audio file. Maybe the dummy one where there's a line representing the music pitch.

* Think of how I want to represent it in 3D and start working on it.

#### Week 3:
* Get the 3D visualization done.
* Check all tests for previous work.
* Work on additional functions if time allows.

#### Possible Additional Features:
* Handle other audio types as well?
* Add some user's interaction to the interface.

## Frameworks / APIs
* Cinder: For program loop and visualization.
* SFML: For handling audio files.
* Is there any additional libraries needed to handle audio?
